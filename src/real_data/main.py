    Process multiple combinations of models, seasons, rounds, and countries by running

    This function iterates through all possible combinations of the provided lists
    and executes the real data model for each combination. It provides progress
    feedback and handles errors gracefully.

    Args:
        model_list (list): List of model names to process.
        season_list (list): List of seasons (years) to process.
        game_list (list): List of game numbers to process.

        num_simulations (int): Number of simulations to run.
        ignore_cache (bool): Whether to ignore the cache.
