{"130": "Checking sampler transitions treedepth.\n8000 of 2000 (400.00%) transitions hit the maximum treedepth limit of 10, or 2^10 leapfrog steps.\nTrajectories that are prematurely terminated due to this limit will result in slow exploration.\nFor optimal performance, increase this limit.\n\nChecking sampler transitions for divergences.\nNo divergent transitions found.\n\nChecking E-BFMI - sampler transitions HMC potential energy.\nE-BFMI satisfactory.\n\nRank-normalized split effective sample size satisfactory for all parameters.\n\nRank-normalized split R-hat values satisfactory for all parameters.\n\nProcessing complete.\n"}
